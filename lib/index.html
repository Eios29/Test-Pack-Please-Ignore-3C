      This is an MCUpdater serverpack directory. If you're reading this,
      then Baughn didn't bother to write a proper webpage.
    <p>
      <b>Important:</b> Before running Minecraft, you must configure
      MCUpdater to allocate more than the default 1G of memory. In the
      settings screen, change max memory size to 4G or more.
    <p>
      Links:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="MCUpdater-Bootstrap.jar">MCUpdater Bootstrap</a><br>

          This is a preconfigured bootstrapper for MCUpdater. If you
          download and run it, you'll get an automatic link for this
          pack. Alternately you can download it from their main
          website and manually add the ServerPack url, below.
        <li><a href="ServerPack.xml">ServerPack</a>.
        <li><a href="packs">Rest of the pack, for manual inspection.</a></li>
      </ul>
